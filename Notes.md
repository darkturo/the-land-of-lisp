Some Annotations while reading the book
=======================================

I have used functional languagues before like hope and haskell, and it was a
little bit surprising for me that Lisp (Common Lisp, which is what I'm
learning), allows the usage of variables. I guess this is one of the features
that makes it to be multiparadigm. In any case is interesting stuff.
