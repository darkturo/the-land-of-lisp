Some Annotations while reading the book
=======================================

I have used functional languagues before like hope and haskell, and it was a
little bit surprising for me that Lisp (Common Lisp), allows the usage of
variables. I guess this is one of the features that makes it to be
multiparadigm. In any case is interesting stuff. 

I'm getting familiar with more specific syntax for Common Lisp, and despite I'm
initially not so comfortable with the names, I have to say that is more or less
bearable. New keywords I learned: cons, cdr and car, cond, if, when, unless,
equal and all its variances, and some more. 

Im already in chapter 8, and I'm still interested in keeping learning lisp;
however, I'm not so sure now, if the idea of using games as a didactical tool
to learn programming, is that good as I initially thought. I'll keep reading...
