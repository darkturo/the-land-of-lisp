The Land of Lisp
================
I'm reading the "Land of Lisp", a book for learning Lisp while making simple
games. I saw it in the library of a friend of mine, and I really got capture by
the funny cover, the crazy looking comic strips, and how the writer sets the
scenario for just another book of Lisp... Okay, okay. It may be not "just
another", check out its webpage, is simply cool :-)
